## Description

For this project, we wanted to make a website for a non-profit foundation where they could accept or deny applications from students and monitor students who have been accepted or denied. The website would also allow the students to apply through the website itself and allow people to learn about the foundation and even send in donations.



## Installation

To install the project, you can visit this GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/ThomasCsk/scholar-foundation](https://github.com/ThomasCsk/scholar-foundation) and either clone the repository or download it as a zip file.


## Usage

To use this project, please visit this website: [https://vast-brushlands-01770.herokuapp.com/](https://vast-brushlands-01770.herokuapp.com/) and make an account to gain access to our Scholar Foundation's Dashboard! The website itself is fairly simplistic, but here's a quick runthrough:
- **About:** The Homepage for this website is the About page, where you can read about this foundation and the reasons for it's creation. 
- **Staff:** The Staff page shows you the current staff/administrators of this foundation along with a small section where they talk about themselves.
- **FAQs:** The Frequently Asked Questions page, is where you can go to read questions asked by students and parents and are answered by the administrators. 
- **Dashboard:** There are two main dashboards for this website, the student dashboard and the administrator dashboard. You will be routed to one of the two based on whether your account has administrator privileges or not.
  - **Student Dashboard:** For the Student Dashboard, you can apply to the foundation as a student. Once you apply to the foundation, you can edit your application at any time.
  - **Administrator Dashboard:** For the Admin Dashboard, you see all applications that are currently pending. You can click on each application to have all information on it pop up and then either accept or deny the application. You also have access to look up any student based on their name.
- **Donate:** The Donate page gives you the contact info for the administrator in charge of handling donations, so that you can talk about the best way to donate to this foundation.
